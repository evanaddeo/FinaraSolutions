<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<h3>Finara</h3>

There are many solid budgeting & spend analyzer apps across the internet; however, I didn't find one that entirely suited my needs and allowed flexible tracking across multiple devices in a format optimized for my goals. I wanted to create a budgeting app designed for young professionals to quickly and easily track spending, analyze trends/metrics, and ultimately set themselves up for success.

Here's why:
* Your 20s are often the most crucial time in your left for saving, investing, and building wealth far into your future
* You shouldn't have to rely on bank statement 'auto-tracking' software that often misclassifies purchases
* Customizable budget categories and spend allocation is critical to maintaining a healthy lifestyle that still allows fiscally smart decision-making
